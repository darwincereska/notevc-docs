## What is NoteVC?

**NoteVC (Note Version Control)** is a version control system for Markdown files. It allows you to track changes at a heading level instead of just files.

## Features

- **Block-level tracking:** Version control at heading granularity
- **Frontmatter support:** Control versioning with YAML frontmatter (tags, title, autocommit, enabled)
- **Smart commits:** Only commit changed blocks
- **Block restoration:** Restore individual sections without affecting the entire file
- **Rich diffs:** See exactly which sections changed
