## Why Block-Level?

Traditional version control tracks entire files. But your notes aren't monolithic—they're collections of ideas, tasks, and thoughts. NoteVC understands this.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Granular History" icon="document">
    Track changes to individual headings, paragraphs, and lists. See exactly what changed, when, and why.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Merging" icon="puzzle">
    Edit different sections simultaneously without conflicts. NoteVC merges changes intelligently at the block level.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Markdown-Native" icon="pencil">
    Built specifically for Markdown. No adapters, no compromises. Just pure, block-aware version control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time Travel" icon="rocket">
    Restore individual blocks from any point in history. Keep your document structure while recovering lost content.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Perfect For

- **Personal Knowledge Management** — Track the evolution of your notes and ideas
- **Documentation Teams** — Collaborate on docs without stepping on each other's toes

## See It In Action

```markdown
## My Research Notes

### Literature Review
<!-- This block has its own version history -->
Key findings from Smith et al. (2024)...

### Methodology  
<!-- This block was edited separately -->
We employed a mixed-methods approach...

### Results
<!-- This block is brand new in v3.2 -->
Initial data shows promising trends...
```

Each section maintains its own history. Change one, leave the others untouched. Merge updates without conflicts. It's version control that works the way you think.
